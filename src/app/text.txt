poem
Will act silly just to make u smile,
Never leaving whatever u do (thumbs down) — that’s my style.
Always there to listen when u sed “bs mere upar mt nikala karo,”
Even when u mad, I’ll still be like “ok bro 😭.”

Dying to meet u irl since the day I saw u in sareeee,
Bro that vision still lives rent free.
Those 19 pics u sent on a single day yaar,
Had me grinning like a fool, u my piyaar.

I know I’m acting like you’re about die 😂,
But fr u my reason why.
Always stay happy cutiepie, no study stress,
Fuck CFA and all that mess.

u r the only friend who truly cares,
sharing and talking with u, nothing else compares.

U r my 5 feet LeBron James, female Messi,
No one else could ever impress me.
Would do anything to get these days back,
Coz with u, life never felt outta track.
(not even close to how good u write tho -- i tried xD)
